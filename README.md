# Persona AI

An intelligent conversational AI platform that leverages advanced LLM capabilities to create dynamic, context-aware AI personas. Users can interact with personalized AI agents that learn and adapt to their communication patterns.

This is an **active learning project** exploring cutting-edge AI architecture patterns, agentic workflows, and modern full-stack development practices.

**Focus Areas:**
- Multi-agent orchestration and complex reasoning
- Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual awareness
- Production-grade AI backend infrastructure
- Full-stack AI application development
- LLM-powered agent design patterns
